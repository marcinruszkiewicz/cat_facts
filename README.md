# CatFacts

The best learning projects should be practical ones, so with that in mind - let's learn Elixir by making a Discord bot. Our bot will be required to do the following:

1. Once the bot is invited to a Discord server, people should be able to type a `!catfact` command in any channel, and the bot should respond to that command in the same channel with an appropriate cat fact.
2. An administrator of the Discord server should be able to add such facts to some kind of a database, so that our bot's responses are unique to that server. One server's cat facts should not be seen in any other server the bot is in.
3. We should test our code properly, so that we can be sure that it works as expected.
